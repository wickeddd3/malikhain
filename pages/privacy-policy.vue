          users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected
          or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests
          that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical
          effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical
          (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or

          information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge,
          except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the
          way we maintain certain services, after you delete your information, residual
          copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers
          and may remain in our backup systems.
