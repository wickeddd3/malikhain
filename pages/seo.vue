            Increasing organic search traffic in itself is not a measure of success.
            We look closely at the data to understand what search behaviour drives
            revenue for your business. We monitor how these users behave on your
            website to ensure content is relevant and optimised to convert.

            Too often organic search operates in isolation. We focus on what role
            organic search plays in your <span class="red--text">broader digital marketing funnel</span>.
            Is organic search driving value at the top or the bottom of the funnel?
            Is content helping drive conversions? Is organic complementing or
            competing with your paid strategy? Is your <span class="red--text">SEO migration</span> negatively
            affecting your search rankings?

            We future-proof our SEO strategies by focusing on quality content and
            avoiding over-optimisation. Content plays an important role in nurturing
            users through the funnel – which means content produced for organic search
            can have broader benefits which are often not realised. Our <span class="red--text">agencies’</span>
            consultative and integrated approach considers both the opportunities
            and implications of content outside organic search.
